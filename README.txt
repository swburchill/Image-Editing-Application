All operations are available by right clicking after loading an image
All operators will appear one at a time with a spin box which can be controlled by typing a value or by highlighting the value amd scrolling with the scroll wheel. You can also use the up and down arrows for single increments. Spin box values are in percentages for all the factors such as contrast and brightness
